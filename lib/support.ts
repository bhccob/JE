// The Support page's content (round 2, 2026-10-28). Taken from the store's current site (pages/faq, pages/warranty,
// pages/returns, pages/service; the warranty policy is dated 19 March 2026), without what contradicts the owner's facts:
// installation services and their labour warranty, technicians and on-site visits, prices, financing and efficiency
// figures. The old FAQ's own answers were generic (dollar prices, US tax credits), so the questions here are the store's
// facts as the rest of the site states them. Everything is listed in docs/content-placeholders.md to confirm.

  {
    q: 'Who installs what I buy?',
    a: 'A licensed electrician for inverters and panels, and an HVAC technician for solar air conditioners, as the manufacturers require. Jontai Energy sells and delivers; it does not install.',
  },
  { q: 'What do you deliver?', a: 'Large items, such as furniture from the second floor and large generators. Ask about delivery when you buy.' },
  { q: 'Can I see products before I buy?', a: 'Yes. Everything is on the floor at Cumana 73, with furniture one flight up.' },
  { q: 'Are prices online?', a: 'No. Request a quote and the store replies by email with current prices and what is in stock, or ask in store.' },
  {
    q: 'How do I claim under warranty?',
    a: 'Call, WhatsApp or email us, or bring the product and its receipt to the store. We assess every claim within 5 business days.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I return something?',
    a: 'Yes, within 14 days with the receipt, if it is unused and in its original packaging. A faulty product is handled under the warranty.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you repair what you sell?',
    a: 'Bring it in with the receipt. The diagnosis is free when the fault may be under warranty; outside warranty, a repair is quoted before any work starts.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I join Rewards?',
    a: 'Open your membership in store at Cumana 73 and collect your loyalty card. The code on the card is your member login.',
